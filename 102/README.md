# 102 - Orchestration and observation: Understand state of workflows and guard against failure

## Agenda

- Tasks
- Logging - observe
- Runtime context - introspect runs
- Retries - automatically retry on failure
- States - understand your workflow state
- Blocks - save configuration with a handy form
- More resources

## Lab

- Use a flow with two tasks that grabs weather data from open-meteo  
- Pass data between the tasks
- Add retries (add an exception to force a failure)
- Run your flow as a Python script
- Stretch 1: Log the name of the flow run
- Stretch 2: Create a block in the UI
- Stretch 3: Load the block in code and use it
